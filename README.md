You need a freestanding GCC build to compile this for now. theres not much to see overall
to build the cross compilers, you have to adjust the build scripts to point at your proper user directories.
might also have to do that for the makefiles, idk, it was never really intended that anyone other than me even builds this thing

Most of this is stolen from the

# Limine C Template
